2025/05/08 6:15:29 PM CET,Excited,Yes it seemed to follow my thoughts,In the middle of the experience ,I felt like i was connected,No,Yes it seemed to track my curiosity,The sound,No
2025/05/08 8:40:58 PM CET,Interested and engaged,Yes,Yes during moments of happiness,Not so much,"Clenching teeth, squinting and applying mental pressure",Hard to say,The whole experience was really interesting ,Wider range of sonication 
2025/05/08 9:36:26 PM CET,Immersed,"Yes very much so, more anxgst and focus = more sounds, relaxed and music relaxes with you",Yes when it slowed and sped up with my mood,If I relaxed it slowed ,Clenching and breathing slowly ,Yes it matched my energy,,
2025/05/09 11:44:30 AM CET,It was very interesting kind of weird,Yes if i locked in then it stopped being so frantic,Yeah when i locked in,"Yes, i could chill out or think about more stressful stuff",Locking in,Yes i think the low freq was a good representation of being locked in,The bars going up and down dependant on my brain waves,Maybe make the connection between music and brain more obvious
2025/05/09 2:13:37 PM CET,Very excited and intrigued ,"Yes, I heard distortion in the sound and changes in the frequencies based on if I was laughing or not",I noticed the sound getting more complex when I laughed ,"Yes, I felt that based on what I was doing or focusing on, the sound would change accordingly ","Yes, looking at my phone then back up and laughing ","Yes, it became higher pitched and more complex when I would get more excited ",It was very interesting to see my brain waves change and hear the sound change with it ,"No, this was a great experience"
2025/05/09 3:32:46 PM CET,Fascinating and insightful,"Yes, no doubt. I went in calm and thought of scenarios that would ramp up the activity and all of a sudden it was almost like alarms went off I tried to calm it down and slightly succeeded but with the activity surrounding me it was hard to reach total calm state.","Definitely, since I am ADD i always wondered if my mind is loud but still relaxed am I truly relaxed? And the reading showed a calm state until I thought of uncomfortable situations which ultimately changed the readings.","Yes, as much as possible since there were distractions maybe not full control but after some time it could be obtained.",Overthinking and external forces such as noise and touch,Yes the different sounds indicated tempo and rate in which it was reading my activity. I was trying to connect the sounds to rhythm but it fluctuated too much but the samples gave a good reflection of how much more or less brain activity was going on.,The scientific approach to reading and understanding of how the mind can be influenced and measured.,"I could say a quiter environment but the external noise and movement provided more of true reading of how one's brain activity would be read or understood in a public environment, so no."
2025/05/09 4:31:58 PM CET,Trippy,Definitely feels correlated ,the ambience,,hmm when i was nodding my head,,The click sound it made when the instrument connects to the electrodes is very satisfying ,"Not particularly, the manipulations can be more scaled to make it more musical, but it feels intentional as it is"
2025/05/10 4:05:27 PM CET,"I went through different emotions throughout all the experience, very interesting that was not rappresentino only one emotion ","Yes, they were very related to thoughts and movement","When I was calming and relaxing the sound was matching very Wella that emotional state, and the super distorted sound was rappresentino very well when I felt hyperactivity.","Yes, I notice that it was the most reactive when it was related to physical changes like someone touching you or when you where engaging your sight or not","Mainly physical, the mental one where more difficult to trigger for me",Delta was rappresentino the most a meditative state and calm,"When you put deep thoughts into it, the music was reacting very promptly ","No, probably keep working on it and upgrading it time by time"
2025/05/10 7:01:57 PM CET,Pretty calm ,Yeah mainly through movement and social media ,Especially at the beginning when I was meditating ,Yes depending on what I wanted to feel I could manage it ,Relaxing and physical movement ,Yes ,How the sound would change so easily ,No
2025/05/10 7:03:04 PM CET,Overstimulated ,Yes,When I tried to calm down and breathe the sound became softer,"Yes, by controlling my breathing and my thoughts ",movement,At times,That doing maths stresses me out ,It’s a very cool concept I’d like to explore further 
2025/05/10 7:04:47 PM CET,Cute,Yes,Yes,Not to much,Yes,"Not always, sometimes I was angry but the music doesn't change",When Gabo have touched me,Cut the hair of the people to connect the electrodes to the head
2025/05/10 7:06:27 PM CET,It was spectacular ,Yes! Very actively too!,"I think when it sped up/slowed down, got intense etc.","Relatively, yes",Yes. 100%,"I believe so, since it changed depending on the thoughts I was having",The change in music depending on the mood/thoughts/physical actions that I had.,"Not sure as I'm so new to all of this, but it was a great experience."
2025/05/10 9:56:24 PM CET,So cool that I could control the sound with head movements!,"It would be cool to have it on for a really long time, like during sleep, lunch, activities… and then to speed up the recording to hear how the data changes over time. But I noticed changes with physical movement.","When I was calm, the sound was also calming.","With physical movement. When being still, the sound was quite stable.",Bouncing my head from side to side.,"Yes. It was jumpy when there was a lot of movement and relaxing, when I was relaxed.",Hearing first sounds and then changing them with movement.,"Maybe the UI. There was a lot of information on the screen, I would only keep the alpha, beta… and highlight the important parts. And it would be cool to see which part of the head was controlling specific sound. So knowing where exactly the electrodes were taking the signal from, simplifying the info on the screen, making it more logical, so that everyone would understand where exactly the data was coming from. But overall, sick project!!"
2025/05/11 9:22:12 AM CET,"Engaged, being able to see a reaction of your own brain activity through music and feeling curious of how to interfere with the program through thought and movement. ","Yes, mostly movement but also depending on how you chose to keep your state of mind.","At the beginning, seeing it fairly calm with quieter and calmer music made me feel like you can be in control over your own state. ","Yes, if I wanted more sound to play through the speakers & headphones, I could increase my thinking and move around a bit. ","Yes, when my partner touched my arm the music increased a lot. ","Yes, when I was still and calm, the music reflected this, when I spoke and thought more actively the music felt more lively. ",How interactive it was. Was great to be hooked up to the program and experience the sounds based on my own thinking and feeling. ,"No, its was great. "
2025/05/11 3:08:32 PM CET,"A bit anxious sometimes, because I didn't have a direct control on the output sounds",Yes,Yes,"A little bit. I could give a general sense of quietness or anxiety to the output, but couldn't fine control the levels",Yes,Marginally,"The first, wearing the headset and immediately reading the signals reflected on the monitor ",No
2025/05/11 3:09:04 PM CET,Curious,Yes,"Yes, after few seconds","Yes, based on my thought and movement the sound changed a lot ",Yes,"Yes, I was calm and most of the sounds were low",The change of the sounds soon after my change in thoughts ,"Need to see the final outcome of the experiment, like a full song produced by the thoughts"
